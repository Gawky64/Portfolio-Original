            <h1>Get to know Photoshop</h1>
             <p> This tutorial introduces you to the Photoshop work area and shows you how to open and save your images, zoom in and out, and undo mistakes.</p>
             <h2>1. Open images</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>In the menu bar, choose File > Open to open existing images.</li>
                <li>In the menu bar, choose File > New to create a new image from scratch. Select a document preset. You can customize the preset by typing in your own values, like width and height.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>2. Get familiar with the work area</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Menu bar (at the very top) shows the File, Edit, Image, and other menus that give you access to a variety of commands, adjustments, and panels.</li>
                <li>Options bar (underneath the menu bar) displays options for the tool you are currently working with.</li>
                <li>Tools panel (on the left) contains tools for editing images and creating artwork. Similar tools are grouped together. You can access related tools in a group by clicking and holding a tool in the panel.</li>
                <li>Panels (on the right) include Color, Layers, Properties, and other panels that contain a variety of controls for working with images. You can find the full list of panels under the Window menu.</li>
                <li>Document window (in the middle) displays the file you’re currently working on. Multiple open documents show up in tabs in the Document window.</li>
                <li>Close image: Choose File > Close.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>3. Learn how to zoom and pan</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>The Zoom tool is located in the Tools panel. Change from Zoom In to Zoom Out in the options bar.</li>
                <li>The Hand tool, also located in the Tools panel, allows you to pan around a large or zoomed-in image.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>4. Undo a command</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>To undo the last thing you did, choose Edit > Undo or press Control+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (macOS).</li>
                <li>To redo the last thing you did, choose Edit > Redo or again press Control+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (macOS).</li>
                <li>To undo multiple steps, choose Edit > Step Backward multiple times, or select a step in the History panel.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>5. Save your work</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Choose File > Save or File > Save As.</li>
                <li>Saving in Photoshop format (.psd) will retain layers, type, and other editable Photoshop properties. It’s best to save your image in PSD format while you’re still working on it.</li>
                <li>Saving in JPEG (.jpg) or PNG (.png) format will save as a standard image file that can be shared, opened by other programs, and posted online. When you’re finished editing, save a copy in one of these formats too.</li>
             </ul>
